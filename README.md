# The Odin Project: Etch A Sketch
## Description
A practice project with JavaScript. Implementing a web version of a toy called Etch A Sketch. User can draw on a square grid, user can change color and size. Main challenge was getting grid layout to look the way it was inteded while at the same time allowing resizing. Instead of grid layout ended up using flexbox (lack of experience with grid layout at the time).
## Installation
Nothing to install, working game can be found [here](https://ykoziy.github.io/etch-a-sketch/ "here").
